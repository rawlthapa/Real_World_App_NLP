## Project Overview

Natural Language Processing is a key area of Artificial Intelligence, enabling computers to understand and interact with human languages. This project explores core NLP applications through practical examples and code snippets, allowing users to learn and implement essential NLP techniques.

### Applications Covered
- **Text Classification**: Spam detection, sentiment analysis
- **Machine Translation**: Translating text between languages
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identifying and categorizing names and organizations
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Determining if a text is positive, negative, or neutral
- **Word Embeddings**: Dense vector representations of words for capturing semantic meaning

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language
- **spaCy**: For text processing, NER, and tokenization
- **NLTK**: For stemming and other linguistic processing
- **scikit-learn**: For machine learning models, including sentiment analysis
- **pandas** and **numpy**: For data manipulation and analysis

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
